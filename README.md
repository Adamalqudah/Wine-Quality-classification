# Wine-Quality-classification
 The "Wine Quality Classification" project aims to predict wine quality using physicochemical data, utilizing a dataset from Kaggle. It employs three machine learning algorithms—k-nearest neighbors (KNN), decision trees, and random forests—to classify the wine quality.
